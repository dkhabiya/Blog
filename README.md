# Gastronome

    Food! Who doesnâ€™t love food? I love food! Love the idea of sharing my experiences with food using literature. 
Gastronome is a food blog that documents the fact that food is for the soul. This application will allow users to blog about food. 
A blog that will chronicle authentic recipes, or experiential food or just about anything that one is cooking or enjoying. 
With a story and images accompanying the blog post, this application will celebrate the awesomeness of food.

    A user must be logged into create/edit/delete a blog and to add comments to other blogs. 
This blog uses all 7 routes of the RESTful API architecture.

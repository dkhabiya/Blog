# Gastronome

Food! Who doesnâ€™t love food? I love food! Love the idea of sharing my experiences with food using literature. 
Gastronome is a food post that documents the fact that food is for the soul. This application will allow users to post about food. 
A post that will chronicle authentic recipes, or experiential food or just about anything that one is cooking or enjoying. 
With a story and images accompanying the post post, this application will celebrate the awesomeness of food.

A user must be logged into create/edit/delete a post and to add comments to other posts. 
This post uses all 7 routes of the RESTful API architecture. 
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
